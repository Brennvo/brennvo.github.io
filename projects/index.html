                I built this application because I found myself creating what I
                call "MeMojis" during text messaging conversations. A "MeMoji"
                contains a variation of a hat, smiley face, shirt, pant, and
                shoe — all stacked on top of each other — to create a fancy
                stick figure. Usually, I'd sift through all of the emojis in
                order to find ones that would look best stacked on top of each
                other. To save myself the browsing and formatting time, I
                decided to create this application to speed up the process and
                allow others to start sharing their MeMojis, too.

              <p>
                In this application, a user can build their character, copy it
                to their clipboard, and then share it amongst their friends.

                As a participant of many secret santa gift exchanges (before
                COVID times), I always liked that it meant I only needed to
                spend money on a single gift. However, I disliked that I was
                only thinking about one other individual in the group leading up
                to the event. To solve this problem, I came up with the North
                Poll; a slight twist on the secret santa exchange. The idea is
                that each individual would contribute the price of a single gift
                — which can be configured — to the group so that each
                participant can receive a gift. Then, when the polls open in The
                North Poll, individuals are encouraged to post suggestions for
                each participant and vote on the one that is their favorite.
                When the polls close and the most popular suggestion is
                determined, the group administrator will hypothetically purchase
                the gifts for each participant and reveal them to the group when
                they formally meet in person.
              </p>

              <p>
                This keeps the integrity of purchasing a single gift with the
                benefit of having an influence on what each participant
                receives.
              </p>
