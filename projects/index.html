                In this application, a user can build an emoji stick figure and
                copy it to their clipboard to share it with others.
              </p>
              <p>
                I built this application because I was frequently creating fancy
                emoji stick figures. They included a variation of a hat, smiley
                face, shirt, pant, and shoe — all stacked together. Usually, I'd
                sift through the thousands of emojis, trying to find the
                emoticons that worked best. To save myself the time, I decided
                to create this application to speed up the process and allow
                others to start sharing their creations, too.

              <p>
                I am currently building this application to make gift exchanges
                more practical.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a participant of many secret santa gift exchanges (before
                COVID times), I always liked that it meant I only needed to
                spend money on a single gift. However, I disliked that I was
                only thinking about one other individual in the group leading up
                to the event. To solve this problem, I came up with the North
                Poll; a slight twist on the secret santa exchange. The idea is
                that each individual would contribute the price of a single gift
                — which can be configured — to the group so that each
                participant can receive a gift. Then, when the polls open in The
                North Poll, individuals are encouraged to post suggestions for
                each participant and vote on the one that is their favorite.
                When the polls close and the most popular suggestion is
                determined, the group administrator will hypothetically purchase
                the gifts for each participant and reveal them to the group when
                they formally meet in person.
              </p>

              <p>
                This keeps the integrity of purchasing a single gift with the
                benefit of having an influence on what each participant
                receives.
              </p>
