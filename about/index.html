              I was a shy, observant kid who grew up on the outskirts of Washington, D.C. in Northern Virginia.
              My childhood was largely spent on a baseball field or playing
              kick the can with my neighbors in my cul-de-sac. When I wasn't
              running around, I was usually on the Internet; my favorite
              memory being a message board I created for my elementary
              homeroom so that we could communicate outside of the classroom.

          <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
              I went into college as an undeclared major. At first, I
              thought I might like something related to nutrition given my personal
              interests in fitness, but I quickly realized there was more to
              it than protein shakes and dumbbells. A year later, I decided to
              major in Business Information Technology without any
              expectations. Rather quickly, though, I found my passion:
              programming.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because I grasp new concepts best with analogies, I was able pickup object
              oriented programming rather quickly given its analogous nature to the physical world around us. My Java class was the first time I recall feeling excited
              about schoolwork. I found programming as a way to use my
              creativity to solve challenging problems and articulate abstractions
              associated with software.
            </p>
            <p>
              With my newfound passion in programming, it was clear that this
              was something I wanted to pursue professionally. I made a
              conscious effort to prioritize class projects and internships involving code
              automation and software development in order to keep my skills
              fresh upon graduation.

          <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
              After graduation, I still didn't have a software niche,
              but I was fortunate to begin working with web applications on
              day one. After gaining an understanding of the entire web
              application stack, I found I preferred developing user
              experiences in the browser given my own history of surfing the
              web. Given my organic empathy for these type of users, I highly value
              accessibility, performance, and usability to engineer memorable
              experiences for them on the web.
            </p>
            <p>
              For more sophisticated applications, I've found front end
              tooling to be extremely helpful in speeding up development time
              and ensuring consistency, confidence, and performance in the
              applications I've supported. Given my knack for learning and the
              fast-paced environment of front end development, I enjoy
              tinkering with new tools and leveraging them if appropriate. Some — but
              not all — of the tools I am familiar with include:

              Having lived in Northern Virginia most my life, with the
              exception of college in Blacksburg, I desperately wanted a
              change of scenery. With the warmer weather and tech scene
              conjuring in Austin, I relocated on a whim without ever visiting
              — which is quite unlike my personality. So far, however, I've enjoyed my
              time here <b>immensely</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
              I consider myself a simple person; my favorite things to do are strolling on <a
                href="https://www.austintexas.gov/department/ann-and-roy-butler-hike-and-bike-trail-and-boardwalk-lady-bird-lake"
                target="_blank">Town Lake Trail</a> by bike or foot, going to see live music, or visiting local coffee
              shops (you definitely need to checkout <a href="https://levercraftcoffee.com/pages/levercraft-coffeeshop"
                target="_blank">LeverCraft Coffee</a> on the weekends if you're local). I especially appreciate the
              expressive culture that I encounter on a daily basis in Austin, which can only help but complement the <a
                aria-label="Photo of Mount Bonnell will open in a new window." href="../images/bonnell.jpeg"
                target="_blank">astonishing scenery</a> given Austin's proximity to the Hill Country of Texas.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you're in the Austin area and would like to connect, feel
              free to reach out by using any of my contact links on this
              website.

      <h2>Personality Type</h2>
      <p>If you're just as much intrigued with the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator as I am, you might be curious to know
        that I classify as an <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality" target="_blank">INFJ</a>. If
        this is the first time you're hearing these terms, no worries. If I do ever do connect with you, though, the
        conversation will likely be more deep and sophisticated than your typical ice breaker. Just a heads up!
