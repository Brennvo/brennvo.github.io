                I built this application because I found myself creating what I
                like to call "MeMojis" in my iMessage conversations. A "MeMoji"
                contains a variation of a hat, smiley face, shirt, pant, and
                shoe — all stacked on top of each other — to create a fancier
                looking stick figure. Usually, I'd have to sift through all of
                the possible emojis and find ones that would fit the bill. So
                instead of having to find all the possible combinations and
                format it myself in iMessage, I created this application to
                share my creative idea with others and allow them to share their
                MeMojis with other people.
              </p>

              <p>
                In this application, a user can build their character, copy it
                to their clipboard, and then share it amongst their friends.

                As a participant of many secret santa gift exchanges (before
                COVID times), I always liked that it meant I only needed to
                spend money on a single gift. However, I disliked that I was
                only thinking about one other individual in the group leading up
                to the event. To solve this problem, I came up with the North
                Poll; a slight twist on the secret santa exchange. The idea is
                that each individual would contribute the price of a single gift
                — which can be configured — to the group so that each
                participant can receive a single gift. Then, when the polls open
                in The North Poll, individuals are encouraged to post
                suggestions for each participant and vote on the suggestion that
                is their favorite. When the polls close and the most popular
                suggestion is determined, the group administrator will
                hypothetically purchase the gifts for each participant and
                reveal them to the participants when they formally meet in
                person.
              </p>

              <p>
                This keeps the integrity of only purchasing a single gift with
                the benefit of playing a factor on what each participant will
                receive.
              </p>
