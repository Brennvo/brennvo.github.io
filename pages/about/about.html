        <h2>The Full Story</h2>
        <p>
          My introduction to web content creation
          <i>technically</i> began in 2006 when I was in the fourth grade. I
          wanted my homeroom to keep in touch outside of the classroom, and
          given that cellphones weren't as widespread, I started an
          <a href="http://brennan.smfforfree2.com/" target="_blank"
            >online discussion board</a
          >
          by leveraging a free hosting service. It was fun, and surpsingly
          taught me how to Google for problems and solutions at an early age.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b
            >But my real passion for software engineering began at Virginia
            Tech, where I was first introduced to programming.</b
          >
          I vividly remember sitting in my chair in chilly Blacksburg, Virginia
          — meticulously reading my Java textbook with blankets and a hoodie —
          being in total awe with the analgous nature of object oriented
          programming to physical objects in real life. It was the first time in
          a long time where things in school just started to <i>make sense</i>.
          It took off from there, and my programming classes were starting to
          feel more like something I would do for fun and not for a grade.
          Eventually,
          <a
            href="https://pamplin.vt.edu/news/2018/04/2018-distinction.html"
            target="_blank"
            >when graduation rolled around</a
          >, I realized that I was most interested in engineering the graphical
          user interface (GUI) for interfacing with other web APIs. I like to
          think it has to do with my artistic background — such that instead of
          starting with a white piece of paper, I traded it for a blank webpage.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since then, I've supported a variety of web applications as a front
          end engineer.
          <b
            >I'm especially knowledable in building composable user interface
            components with React to support design, accessibiliy, and
            performance patterns.</b
          >
          I like to read, which bodes particularly well in the fast paced
          JavaScript front end ecoystem; so I'm never afraid to try something
          new if the tool fits the job.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b
            >However, the most valuable lesson I've learned is not a technical
            one, but rather, one focused on empowering others.</b
          >
          I've learned to instill empathy as a daily driver in all that I do; if
          I can make the experience better for those around me, it
          <b>will</b> help the applications that I contribute to holistically.
          Be it making the distributed application a smaller file size,
          priorizing accessibility, or leaving traceable comments and
          documentation to help my teammates, I understand that I am not an
          engineer of one. It is the users and team around me that keep my
          software engineering goals and aspirations alive.
